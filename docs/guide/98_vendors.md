# Vendor libraries

Due to the great amount of vendor libraries, many features and functionalities
are easy to use without reinventing the wheel. The advantage of this is a
less time-consuming development process of applications. Learning to write
enterprise applications means learning how to use these vendor libraries.

### Async.js

Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions
for working with asynchronous JavaScript. Async provides around 20 functions
that include the usual 'functional' suspects (map, reduce, filter, each) as
well as some common patterns for asynchronous control flow (parallel, series,
waterfall). All these functions assume you follow the node.js convention of
providing a single callback as the last argument of your async function.
